dropcards
=========

I know a certain 4-year-old who is just learning how to read. This toy is for us to share.

Would you please help make it better?

Does it need friendlier colors? Would it be more natural if the cards were a little crooked? Should it show more real words and fewer nonsense words? Should it respond to touch?

Let me know.
