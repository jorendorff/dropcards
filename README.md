dropcards
=========

I know a certain 4-year-old who is just learning how to read. This toy is for us to share.

Would you please help make it better?

Does it need friendlier colors? Would it be more natural if the cards were a little crooked? Should it show more real words and fewer nonsense words? Should it respond differently to touch?

What if you picked a totally different direction and ran with it? What else could you do to surprise and delight a child on the threshold of reading?

Let me know.
